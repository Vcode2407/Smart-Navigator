# Smart Navigator - Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive web-based pathfinding algorithm visualizer that demonstrates how different algorithms find the shortest path in a grid.

## Live Demo
[View Live Demo](https://vcode2407.github.io/Smart-Navigator/)

## Features
- Multiple Algorithms: Compare A*, BFS, and Dijkstra algorithms
- Interactive Grid: Click to add obstacles and set start/end points
- Visual Animation: Watch the algorithm explore paths in real-time
- Responsive Design: Works on desktop and mobile devices

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Pathfinding Algorithms (A*, BFS, Dijkstra)

## How to Use
1. Select a pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown menu
2. Click on the grid to place obstacles (walls)
3. Click "Start" to visualize the algorithm
4. Observe how the navigator finds the optimal path

## Algorithms Implemented

### A* (A-Star)
Uses heuristics to find the shortest path efficiently by considering both the cost to reach a node and the estimated cost to the goal.

### BFS (Breadth-First Search)
Explores all neighboring nodes level by level, guaranteeing the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Finds the shortest path by exploring nodes with the lowest cumulative cost first.
