# \- Pathfinding Algorithms (A\*, BFS, Dijkstra)

# 

# \## 🚀 How to Use

# 1\. Select a pathfinding algorithm from the dropdown

# 2\. Click on the grid to place obstacles (walls)

# 3\. Click "Start" to visualize the algorithm

# 4\. Watch as the navigator finds the optimal path!

# 

# \## 📝 Algorithms Explained

# 

# \### A\* (A-Star)

# Uses heuristics to find the shortest path efficiently by considering both the cost to reach a node and the estimated cost to the goal.

# 

# \### BFS (Breadth-First Search)

# Explores all neighboring nodes level by level, guaranteeing the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

# 

# \### Dijkstra's Algorithm

# Finds the shortest path by exploring nodes with the lowest cumulative cost first.
